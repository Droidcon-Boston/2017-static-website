                            We want Droidcon Boston to be a safe and productive environment for everyone. To that end, this code of conduct spells out the behavior we support and don't support at conferences. All attendees, speakers, sponsors and volunteers at our conference are required to agree to the following Code of Conduct. Organizers will enforce this code throughout the event.<br /><br />

 Our conference is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, national origin, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), or technology choices. We invite you to help us make Droidcon Boston a place that is welcoming and respectful to all participants. So that everyone can focus on the conference itself, learning and growing in their own way, and the great networking and community richness that happens when we get together in person, we will not tolerate harassment of conference participants in any form-in person or online.
<br /><br />
Examples of harassment include offensive comments, verbal threats or demands, intimidation, stalking, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of sessions or events, and unwelcome physical contact or sexual attention. Harassment also includes slights and negative messages, both unintended and intentional, based solely on appearance (sometimes called microaggressions). Sexual language and imagery are not appropriate for any conference setting.
<br /><br />
We expect all participants to follow the Code of Conduct during the conference. This includes conference-related social events at off-site locations, and in related online communities and social media. Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately. Conference participants violating this Code of Conduct may be expelled from the conference without a refund, and/or banned from future Droidcon Boston events.
<br /><br />
Need Help?
<br /><br />
Reach out to any conference organizer if you have questions or concerns about the Code of Conduct itself or the behavior of any participants before, during or after the conference. We will treat all violations of the Code of Conduct seriously. You can also email us at coc@droidcon-boston.com.
