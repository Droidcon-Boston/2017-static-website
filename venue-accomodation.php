                            <p> Our speakers and sponsors are invited to join influential members of the Boston mobile dev community for mixing over appetizers, music, and an open bar at the Revere Hotel's Emerald Lounge. An allusion to Boston's sprawling system of public parks called the "Emerald Necklace," this ultra lounge stands out among downtown Boston hotels as a casually sophisticated space to spend the evening.
